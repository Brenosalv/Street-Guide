# Stree Guide
Street Guide is an embedded system developed for blind people. With this system, they can walk on the street while listening to establishments info. This way, they know if there is a hospital, a bank, a police department, a store, a bar, a school or other establishments near to them. These establishments or institutes use RFID Tags to identify blind people on the street who have the hardware that recognize the tags and emit an audio informing them about name, schedule, promotions and etc of the establishment itself.

The system was developed with C++ and RFID technologies.
